4917

This is an emulator for the 4917 CPU created for CS1 at The University of
New South Wales.

A video explaining the CPU is available at this link:

I have also found documentation of the instructions at this link:

A counting program is available in the examples directory

If you are looking for something to contribute to, the emulator is fully
functional. We are currently lacking on examples. If you would like to help
with examples, make some and send me a pull request.

How to run the countdown example:

$ ./bin/4917 examples/countdown.4917
